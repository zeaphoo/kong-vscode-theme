# Kong VS Code Themes

_Kong_ is a fork of the [Picta VS Code themes](https://github.com/KurtBoehm/picta-vscode-theme) providing much more complete source code highlighting with a modified and extended colour palette:

These colours have the following general meanings:

| Colour | Meaning            | Notes                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Red    | Keywords           |                                                                |
| Orange | Variables          | more reddish than GitHub orange to make space for Picta yellow |
| Yellow | Unknown            | **new colour**                                                 |
| Olive  | _None_             | **new colour**                                                 |

| Cyan   | _None_             | **new colour**                                                 |
| Blue   | Enums              | A different shade is used for literals                         |
| Indigo | Types              | more blueish than GitHub purple to make space for Picta purple |
| Purple | Concepts (C++)     | **new colour**                                                 |
| Pink   | Modules/Namespaces | more reddish than GitHub pink to make space for Picta purple   |

Furthermore, _italic_ identifiers represent member variables/functions (attributes/methods in OOP parlance) and **bold** represents function/type/template parameters.
The _Extended_ themes additionally underline constants (if the language support is able to determine immutability).

The extended themes look as follows when applied to a C++ program using `clangd`:
